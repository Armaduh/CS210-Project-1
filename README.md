The project I chose to post was the 24 hour clock.
It displays both a 12 and 24 hour clock on a website at all times and the code seamlessly integrates into projects.
The simplicity of the program was done well, not using more code than required.
Learning more languages and adapting the programs capabilities and modularity to other programs would be great.
The hardest part of the project was learning how to format the clock and display it in the proper visual formats.
Brute forcing myself to continue coding when I wanted to give up was my way through it.
The C++ skill and integration with other languages made it adaptable to other programs.
The simplicity makes it easy for others to use and dissect!
